State Bank of India (SBI), the largest lender of the country, revised its fixed deposit (FD) interest rates on select maturities with effect from today, the lender said on its website, sbi.co.in. The rate of rise in SBI FD interest rates is between 0.05-0.10 per cent or 5-10 basis points. One basis point is equivalent to 0.01 per cent. SBI has hiked its fixed deposit interest rates on deposits below Rs. 1 crore. SBI hiked its FD interest rates ahead of the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy review outcome on December 5.

Insert into PRODUCTPORTALNEWS (NEWSID,CONTENT,DATEADDED,HEADLINE,STATUS) values (89,'Linux and the open source business model are far different today than many of the early developers might have hoped. Neither can claim a rags-to-riches story. Rather, their growth cycles have been a series of hit-or-miss milestones.

The Linux desktop has yet to find a home on the majority of consumer and enterprise computers. However, Linux-powered technology has long ruled the Internet and conquered the cloud and Internet of Things deployments. Both Linux and free open source licensing have dominated in other ways.

Microsoft Windows 10 has experienced similar deployment struggles as proprietary developers have searched for better solutions to support consumers and enterprise users.

Meanwhile, Linux is the more rigorous operating system, but it has been beset by a growing list of open source code vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.

The Windows phone has come and gone. Apple''s iPhone has thrived in spite of stagnation and feature restrictions. Meanwhile, the Linux-based open source Android phone platform is a worldwide leader.

Innovation continues to drive demand for Chromebooks in homes, schools and offices. The Linux kernel-driven Chrome OS, with its browser-based environment, has made staggering inroads for simplicity of use and effective productivity.

Chromebooks now can run Android apps. Soon the ability to run Linux programs will further feed open source development and usability, both for personal and enterprise adoption.

One of the most successful aspects of non-proprietary software trends is the wildfire growth of container technology in the cloud, driven by Linux and open source. Those advancements have pushed Microsoft into bringing Linux elements into the Windows OS and containers into its Azure cloud environment.

"Open source is headed toward faster and faster rates of change, where the automated tests and tooling wrapped around the delivery pipeline are almost as important as the resulting shipped artifacts," said Abraham Ingersoll, vice president of sales and solutions engineering at Gravitational.

"The highest velocity projects will naturally win market share, and those with the best feedback loops are steadily gaining speed on the laggards," he told LinuxInsider.


Advancement in Progress
To succeed with the challenges of open source business models, enterprises have to devise a viable way to monetize community development of reusable code. Those who succeed also have to master the formula for growing a free computing platform or its must-have applications into a profitable venture.

Based on an interesting GitLab report, 2018 is the year for open source and DevOps, remarked Kyle Bittner, business development manager at Exit Technologies.

That forecast may be true eventually, as long as open source can dispel the security fears, he told LinuxInsider.

"With open source code fundamental to machine learning and artificial intelligence frameworks, there is a challenge ahead to convince the more traditional IT shops in automotive and oil and gas, for example, that this is not a problem," Bittner pointed out.

The future of the open source model may be vested in the ability to curb worsening security flaws in bloated coding. That is a big "if," given how security risks have grown as Linux-based deployments evolved from isolated systems to large multitenancy environments.

LinuxInsider asked several open source innovators to share their views on where the open source model is headed, and to recommend the best practices developers should use to leverage different OS deployment models',to_timestamp('08-OCT-18 10.04.04.984000000 AM','DD-MON-RR HH.MI.SS.FF AM'),'The Future of Open Source','archived');

What has prompted this sudden retrospection among Facebook users is a bug that is bringing the old and long forgotten conversations on Facebook Messenger back in light.

To put in simply, a bug is treating old Messenger conversation as new and making them resurface on the top of conversations in the messaging platform automatically. The issue was first reported by Twitter users, some of whom pointed out that the messages that they didn''t reply to seven years ago popped up in the Messenger tab on Facebook''s native platform. Shortly after, Facebook in a statement to The Verge confirmed the presence of the bizarre issue.


"Some people are seeing older messages on Facebook.com. We are aware of the issue and are actively working to resolve it in as soon as possible...We apologize for the inconvenience," a Facebook spokesperson told the publication without giving an explanation as to what was causing the issue in the first place.

Notably, the bug seems to be nothing more than an issue with the social media platform''s coding. Even so, it has brought a flurry of emotions and reactions among the Tweeps some of whom said that the resurfaced messages brought up the painful memories of people that they had lost in life. Then there were others who said the bug reminded them of their old friends that they haven''t spoken with in years, prompting them to start a conversation.

Facebook Messenger stores the entire log of users conversations dating back to years unless they actively delete all their conversations with other users. The bug, that is haunting the Facebook users, is another reminder of the amount of data the social media giant has on its users.

Interestingly, this is not the first time that Facebook has sent a distress signal. Back in 2015, its "On This Day" feature started showing painful memories to its users. The underlying issue at the time, unlike the recent issue, was that the feature was unable to distinguish between morbid and celebratory memories.',to_timestamp('27-NOV-18 12.10.29.674000000 PM','DD-MON-RR HH.MI.SS.FF AM'),'A new Facebook bug is haunting users with the ghost of past conversations','archived');

?However, it seems to have failed to achieve the stated objectives, as only 4-PBs are operational out of the 11 licensed players. In 1990s also, RBI had made an attempt to create Local Area Banks (LABs) that are currently facing a host of issues," the report said.

Neobanking, offered by fintech companies called Neobanks, includes digital financial services such as payment and money transfer services, loans for businesses and individuals, savings accounts, and other services such as help in budgeting etc. Also unlike traditional banks, neobanks don?t need to have physical branches and may not be chartered with country?s regulators as financial institutions. For instance, Tiger Global-backed Open offering neobanking services to small business or SMEs right from banking, invoicing, and automated bookkeeping.

?Credit and payment are the biggest challenges for SMEs. Payments to vendors and employees take a lot of time and energy. Moreover, credit cards are really under-penetrated in this market. Out of around 50 million SMEs in India, around 5 million are using some kind of an online tool for their business like for GST filing or payment gateway for payment etc. This is a very large problem to address as traditional business banking has not focused on the needs of these businesses,? Open?s CEO Anish Achuthan told Financial Express Online.

As awareness around digital services spreads deeper among Indian SMEs followed by the adoption, ?so over a period of time, there is a much larger opportunity to solve for,? he said as Open today announced partnership with multinational financial services firm Visa to launch a new business credit card along with real-time payments settlement and refunds through API banking suite called Layer. ?With Visa, it is a strategic alliance because with them you can have the largest number of banking partnerships in India. They can help you tap into the proper network,? said Achuthan.

The business card will help small businesses particularly startups to manage their expenses and payouts along with issuing it to employees as well to automate reimbursements. ?No matter how much capital SME and startup raise in less than three years of their launch, they are still not eligible for credit card but there are a lot of payouts they need to make for services from Google, Amazon etc., that can run anywhere from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 1 crore,? said Achuthan. Open underwrites the credit card?s credit based on the company?s funding and the money they have in their bank accounts.

NiYO Solutions is another neobank. The company offers neo-banking services to the blue-collar segment through its Bharat Payroll Solution primarily in unorganized or semi-unorganized labour-intensive sectors to provide them with a platform to manage savings, payments, investments and financial protection (insurance).

While neobanking is a new concept in Asia but in Europe, there are neobanking companies like Revolut, N26, Monzo, etc. that have become unicorns in a few months after launching.

State Bank of India (SBI) has tightened lending terms dramatically for auto dealerships, according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters, seeking to reduce its exposure to risk from a sector in the midst of a sharp downturn. The shadow banking crisis that began to unfold in India during mid-2018 has deepened this year. The liquidity crunch in non-bank financing, higher insurance costs and rises in taxation have served to increase the pressure on the car sector, with monthly auto sales falling by 17-20% since April. Monthly passenger vehicle sales in June fell by the biggest margin in 18 years.

In one internal memo for financing dealers selling vehicles made by Hyundai Motor Co?s India unit, SBI said it is revising the lending terms because of ?growing stress? in the carmaker?s portfolio. Similar memos have been sent to dealerships for all other brands, said a senior SBI official aware of the matter, though Reuters has not seen memos relating to other carmakers. As part of the revised terms, the country?s largest bank by assets has decided to halt lending to dealers of Hyundai Motor India unless they provide a minimum of 25% collateral, it said in the memo.

Hyundai dealers that had already received loans from the bank will also have to provide security of between 25% and 50% of the loan amount, SBI said in the memo dated March 27 and signed by the chief general manager for supply chain financing. Hyundai did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment outside business hours. The company is India?s second-largest carmaker with more than 16% of a market accounting for 3.3 million passenger vehicles in the year to March 31.

Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp?s Indian business, Maruti Suzuki, dominates with a 50% share while rivals including Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and Nissan also produce and sell cars in the country. While it is known that several Indian banks have broadly tightened lending to the auto sector, specifics have not been disclosed. ?There is an auto sales slowdown and we have substantial exposure to autos. We want to stay safe and this was done to mitigate risk and protect us,? said the SBI official, who asked not to be named because the details had not been made public.

SBI?s loan exposure in the auto retail market was 718.8 billion rupees ($10.5 billion) at the end of March, according to regulatory filings. ?In view of the current slowdown in the auto sector, the bank is continuously reviewing its exposure,? SBI told Reuters, adding that it is evaluating the situation and engaging with dealers to ensure the sector does not face any undue stress.

TIGHTER SCRUTINY

Other lenders have also become more wary of lending to dealers with credit lines from different banks. Dipak Gupta, joint managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, earlier this month said some dealers were using credit lines from one bank to pay off another, and banks are now taking a harder look at such practices. In its memo, SBI said that if a dealer had raised funding from more than three banks including SBI, the collateral requirement would be increased to a minimum of 50%. SBI has also cut the credit period for dealers to 60 days from 90 days.

The bank will also monitor stock and inventory levels on a monthly basis to keep tabs on the dealer?s financial health. The tighter scrutiny comes at a time when inventories at dealers have risen to 50-60 days of sales, up from around 45 days previously, according to industry data. In an effort to help its dealers, Maruti Suzuki has tied up with state-run Bank of Baroda for dealer finance and is in talks with other banks to ease strict lending terms, local newspaper Mint reported earlier in July.',to_timestamp('30-JUL-19 08.01.50.635000000 PM','DD-MON-RR HH.MI.SS.FF AM'),'SBI tightens lending terms for auto dealers amid slowdown in sector','active');

ICICI Bank gets top marks on this as the lender not only reported improved asset quality but its management also gave a clear outlook.

The private lender swung to profit in the June quarter because it didn?t need to make big provisions as bad loans fell and core income improved.
